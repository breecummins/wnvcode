ChickenResults.mat Explanation
------------------------------

ChickenResults contains the data gathered from ChickenBatch, and is a preliminary test of ExploreChickenPosition and the chicken distributions generated. The file contains two 3D arrays, ind_results and t_results. These two arrays tabulate data on mosquito/host interactions, and record both which chicken was found by any mosquito and at what time that occured.

The two arrays measure 200x4x160. The first index references an individual mosquito within a given simulation. Because a certain number of mosquitoes will not find a host in a given simulation, the data in these arrays is sorted so that the actual results are grouped at the beginning, with a set of trailing zeros cooresponding to the mosquitoes that didn't find hosts.

The second index references different wind-derived behaviors (upwind, downwind, etc.) for a given chicken distribution. When these simulations were run, each of these behaviors was run simultaneously over the CO2 grid derived from a given chicken distribution. The different behaviors and their cooresponding indices in the arrays are below.

1 = Upwind Movement
2 = Downwind Movement
3 = Crosswind Movement with Upwind Bias
4 = Crosswind Movement with Downwind Bias


The third and final index references which chicken distribution is being used for a particular simulation. This value is described in the file "ChickenLocs Explanation" and the value of the index here cooresponds to the table in that file as well.
