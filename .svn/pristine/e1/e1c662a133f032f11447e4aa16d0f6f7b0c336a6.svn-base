Please find the enclosed manuscript titled "A hybrid model of mosquito-host
encounter rates" being submitted for consideration of publication in PLoS
Computational Biology.

The manuscript describes a spatial hybrid numerical model of interactions
between mosquitoes and roosting birds that accounts for various mosquito
behavioral rules described in the literature, wind velocity, and chemical
cues emitted by hosts which are carried by the wind and diffused in the air.
We provide a unique contribution to the field of computational epidemiology
by combining chemotaxis and advection with an agent-based model.  The
manuscript also makes a connection between our spatial local model and other
popular continuum models.

Thank you for consideration of our manuscript.
